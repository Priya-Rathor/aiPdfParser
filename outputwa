The Advertising Standards Authority of Singapore (ASAS) encourages clear disclosures to maintain consumer trust.",
            "Adherence to Advertising Standards: Uphold honesty and clarity in all advertising efforts.

This aligns with the Singaporean ethos of integrity and multicultural sensitivity. Content created by affiliates should be respectful of Singapore's diverse society and adhere strictly to the truth-in-advertising principles outlined by the Advertising Standards Authority of Singapore (ASAS). Any claims made about products should be verifiable and presented in good taste, ensuring they meet both Lazada's and Singapore�s high standards for commercial communication.",
            "Industry-Specific Regulatory Compliance: Observe additional regulations applicable to specific industries. Application in Singapore: For affiliates marketing products in regulated sectors (e.g., financial services, health supplements), understanding and complying with the relevant regulations, such as those imposed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) or the Health Sciences Authority (HSA), is crucial. This ensures that all promotional content is compliant and not misleading."
